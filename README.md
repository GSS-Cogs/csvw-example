## CSVW Examples

This repository is for housing csvw examples highlighting UK government statistical data represented as csvw (for the purpose of generating linked open data).

Each sub directory contains one example from one data producing partner. Though in most cases the csvw explanations overlap, the snippets and examples have been tailored to each use case with supplementary information provided where required.

This repository is intended as a resource for learning and information sharing, so please do contact us at [info@gss-cogs.uk](info@gss.cogs.uk) if you'd like to get involved or join the conversation.
